Computational Practice
Experiment with the program by making changes to it and keeping track of what those changes do when you re-run the program. Figure out what numbers you can change in the program to:
Make the bubbles tiny or huge
Make the bubbles' motions more vigorous
Change the bubbles' colors
Change the initial number of bubbles
Any other changes you find interesting :-)
